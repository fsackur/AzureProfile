# AzureProfile
A Powershell profile for occasional Azure administrators

# Purpose
To manage Azure, you will surely need to install the Azure powershell modules. This will likely double the number of functions in your session, causing your powershell performance to drag.

Additionally, you will occasionally need to go through authentication.

If only a small part of your day is spent in Azure, you'll want to only load the Azure modules on demand.

This project is aimed at letting you switch into Azure mode when needed, so that you can run without it the rest of the time.
